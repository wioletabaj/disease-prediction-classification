# Description:
A comprehensive binary classification project aimed at predicting the presence of a disease in female patients based on various characteristics. This project employs two machine learning models—Random Forest and Logistic Regression—both trained on a dataset containing clinical and demographic information. The project focuses on data preprocessing, imputation techniques for missing data, feature selection, and model evaluation, with performance comparison using metrics such as Precision-Recall, Accuracy, Sensitivity, and F1-Score.

# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, missing data imputation using KNN, and feature scaling.

Model Development: Utilization of Random Forest and Logistic Regression models for disease prediction.

Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation through confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and AUC scores.

Threshold Optimization: Tuning decision thresholds to maximize F1-Score and precision-recall tradeoff.

Performance Comparison: Comparing the performance of the models on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
